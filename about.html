            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>Aubrey Drake Graham, born on October 24, 1986, is a renowned Canadian rapper and singer who has made an indelible mark on contemporary popular music. Drake is widely recognized for his role in popularizing singing and R&B influences within the hip-hop genre. He initially gained prominence as Jimmy Brooks in the CTV teen drama series "Degrassi: The Next Generation" (2001-08) but embarked on a music career in 2006, releasing his debut mixtape "Room for Improvement" in February of that year. Subsequently, he went on to create mixtapes like "Comeback Season" (2007) and "So Far Gone" (2009) before signing with Young Money Entertainment.

                Drake's first three albums, "Thank Me Later" (2010), "Take Care" (2011), and "Nothing Was the Same" (2013), were critical and commercial successes, propelling him to the forefront of the hip-hop scene. His fourth album, "Views" (2016), explored dancehall elements and dominated the Billboard 200 chart for 13 non-consecutive weeks, a feat not achieved by a male artist in over a decade. This album featured hit singles like "Hotline Bling" and "One Dance," which played a pivotal role in popularizing Afrobeats on a global scale.

                In 2018, Drake released the double album "Scorpion," boasting Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers like "God's Plan," "Nice for What," and "In My Feelings." His highly anticipated sixth album, "Certified Lover Boy" (2021), set a record with nine top 10 hits on the Hot 100, and its lead single "Way 2 Sexy" reached number one. In 2022, Drake released the house-inspired album "Honestly, Nevermind" and a collaborative work, "Her Loss," with 21 Savage. His eighth album, "For All the Dogs" (2023), produced number-one hits like "Slime You Out" and "First Person Shooter," tying him with Michael Jackson for the most number-one singles by a male solo artist.

                Drake is not just a musician; he's also a successful entrepreneur. He co-founded the OVO Sound record label in 2012 and became the "global ambassador" for the Toronto Raptors in 2013. He extended his business ventures into the world of whiskey with Virginia Black and has established the OVO fashion label, the Nocta collaboration with Nike, the production company DreamCrew, and a fragrance house called Better World. Notably, his impact extends to Toronto's tourism, where he was reportedly responsible for 5 percent of the city's annual income in 2018. In 2022, he even obtained partial ownership of the Italian soccer club A.C. Milan.
